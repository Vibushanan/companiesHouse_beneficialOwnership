# Panamapapers in neo4j

Doodles using a third party container - ryguyrg/neo4j-panama-papers - that publishes the Panama Papers in the form of a neo4j database. 

See also: https://gist.github.com/jexp/4a9dfd20cff6e270ea92dd3397ffb4ba for a neo4j loader script. I'm not sure is this is the same as the above container. zip file archived here for completeness/just in case.
